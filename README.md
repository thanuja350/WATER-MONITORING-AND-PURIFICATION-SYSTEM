\# Water Monitoring and Purification System üåäüíß



This project is a \*\*smart water monitoring and purification system\*\* built using a \*\*Raspberry Pi\*\*.  

It monitors \*\*water level, pH, turbidity, and temperature\*\* while automatically controlling a \*\*water pump\*\* and \*\*filtering system\*\* (activated carbon, UV, etc.) through relays.

\## üöÄ Features

\- Real-time monitoring of:

&nbsp; - Water level

&nbsp; - pH

&nbsp; - Turbidity

&nbsp; - Temperature

\- Automatic \*\*pump control\*\* based on water level

\- Automatic \*\*filtering system control\*\* based on water quality

\- Data output to console

\- Easy threshold customization

\- Extendable for:

&nbsp; - Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring

&nbsp; - Data logging

&nbsp; - Alerts for abnormal water quality

\## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

1\. \*\*Raspberry Pi\*\* (any model with GPIO support)

2\. \*\*Water level sensor\*\* (e.g., HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor)

3\. \*\*Water quality sensors\*\*:

&nbsp;  - pH sensor  

&nbsp;  - Turbidity sensor  

&nbsp;  - Temperature sensor  

4\. \*\*Water pump\*\*

5\. \*\*Filtering system\*\* (activated carbon / UV)

6\. \*\*Relays\*\* (to control pump \& filter system)

7\. \*\*Wires \& Breadboard\*\*
